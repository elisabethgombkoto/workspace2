	Suppose,for example we wish to establish the branching factor of the 8-puzzle.
	We calculate the total number of possible moves:
	2 from each corner for a total of 8 corner moves,
	3 from center of each side for a total of 12,
	and 4 from the center of the grid for a grand total of 24.
	This divided by 9,the different possible locations of the blank, gives an average branching factor of 2.67.
